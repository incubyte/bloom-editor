# Module Boundaries

> Generated by /bee:discover from the project's milestone map.
> Edit this file to adjust boundaries as the project evolves.

## Modules

- `editor/` — owns: Tiptap setup, custom extensions, editor state, document model. Depends on: (none)
- `copilot/` — owns: margin comments, chat sidebar, suggestion lifecycle. Depends on: editor, ai-provider, voice
- `voice/` — owns: voice profile creation, storage, tone analysis from links. Depends on: ai-provider
- `ai-provider/` — owns: LLM abstraction layer, provider configs, request routing. Depends on: (none)
- `review/` — owns: blog scoring, web search for references, review UI. Depends on: ai-provider, voice, editor
- `transcription/` — owns: audio recording, file upload, speech-to-text. Depends on: ai-provider
- `storage/` — owns: local draft persistence, file management, settings. Depends on: (none)
- `shell/` — owns: desktop app window, menu bar, app lifecycle. Depends on: (none)

## Rules

- Modules may only import from declared dependencies
- Domain concepts live in their owning module — do not scatter across modules
- No circular dependencies
- When in doubt, duplicate code rather than create a coupling that violates boundaries
